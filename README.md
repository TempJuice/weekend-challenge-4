# weekend-challenge-4

Base Mode

For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee records along with their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month in salary. We will be using Angular, Node/Express, AJAX, and SQL. Any application logic can remain on the client side, but all data storage should be handled by the server and your database. Be sure to include all your CREATE TABLE queries in a database.sql file in your repo!

- [x] The application should first have an input form that collects:

The Employee's First Name
The Employee's Last Name
The Employee's Job Title
The Employee's Salary (Yearly)

- [x] The form should have a submit button that clears out the form and your employees database should store that information.

- [x] Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

- [x] Your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is.

Hard Mode

- [ ] Create an interface on the page that would allow you to toggle employees from active to inactive and back. Whether an employee is_active or not should be a part of your database. Your salary total should only tally active employees and change as employees are changed. Be sure to style the inactive employees differently than active ones.

Pro Mode

- [ ] Our system should be able to change (edit/update) employee names, salaries, and titles.
